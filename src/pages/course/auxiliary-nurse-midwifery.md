Auxiliary Nurse Midwifery was created in India in 1966 by the Mukherjee Committee to spread the concept of health care in rural areas. During the 1950s and 1960s, ANM training was primarily focused on midwifery and maternal and child care. The bigger components of the ANM were later evaluated based on the recommendation.

Today however the course has evolved and is offered as a diploma course which makes the students capable and eligible to provide medical assistance to any senior professional. The course provides knowledge about setting up operation theatre, taking care of various equipment, learning about medical supplies, maintaining records, and also administering timely medication to patients.

It is a great career option for non science students who wish to enter in the healthcare sector. 

Auxiliary Nurse Midwifery covers a wide plethora of subjects ranging from Microbiology, Biological Science, Anatomy, Physiology to Sociology, Fundamentals of Nursing, Behavioural Science and First Aid. 

Today, the profession has grown steadily and now has a very important function in both urban and rural environments.

There are multiple reasons to study ANM courses, including job security, numerous opportunities, a good salary, and concern for people's well-being. One of the most important advantages of studying ANM is the opportunity to work in government sectors with complete job security and gain experience. Those who thrive on the course may be even granted global opportunities.
