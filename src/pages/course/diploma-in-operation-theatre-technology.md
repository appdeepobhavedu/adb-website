A diploma in operation theatre technology is a popular paramedical study. This makes the aspirants capable of working in operation theatre by equipping them with knowledge of preparation of operation theatre, sterilization, equipment maintenance and assisting the nurses and surgeons. 

OT Technicians are hired to assist and help the Doctors and Surgeons during surgeries and emergency procedures. The success of the procedures and the safety of patients depend largely on the reliability of the OT technician.

OT Technicians learn the utilization of numerous diagnostic equipment for example Ventilators, monitors, Defibrillators, C-arm etc. and also patient assessment abilities. Training also concentrates on the knowledge and skills of monitoring infection control policy and procedures in the operation theatre.

The aim of the program is to teach and train candidates in operation theatre technology and the management of operation theatre along with handling a wide range of operating instruments including electronic and advanced equipment used in modern operation theatres.
