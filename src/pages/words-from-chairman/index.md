App Deepo Bhav is derived from the sentiment of Gautam Buddha. In Bodh Gaya, when Gautam Buddha had reached his stage of enlightenment, one of his main disciples, Anand at Sarnath after Gautam Buddha’s first speech of enlightenment to his disciples, asked him - “Till the time you were here, you paved the way for us. But after you are gone, who is going to pave the way for us?” In response to Anand, Gautam Buddha said “App Deepo Bhav” meaning light your own pathway. The values embedded in Gautam Buddha’s disciples were enough for them to light their own paths. Keeping these morals intact, we have built the App Deepo Bhav College. We want to empower our students so that they not only become self sufficient but also act as guides to make others self sufficient.

During the unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed the collapse in global health infrastructure. At the time of the pandemic, we saw the need for a medical institution in the village of Phulparas which was frankly beyond imagination at the time. To cater to the basic livelihood of humanity which is health and education, App Deepo Bhav wishes to stand tall in its endeavour.

App Deepo Bhav also recognises the vivid disparity between the education of a male and a female child. Our aim is to bring equity to the society. Thereby we encourage more female participation in education. Our values stand a high ground and have laid the fundamentals of App Deepo Bhav.

I wish everyone all the very best and success in their careers.

Thank you.
