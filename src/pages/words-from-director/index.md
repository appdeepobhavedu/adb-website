Medical personnel have been at the forefront during the pandemic. Battling each day, working prolonged shifts and serving the nation daily with all their heart and soul. Today, we have left the pandemic behind us and have graduated to a new normal. But this has come at a heft cost to us. We have lost millions of lives in the pandemic. The shortage of human resources in the medical field was exposed. India is a country of over 1.3BN people and for every 1000 people, there are 1.7 paramedics for their care. This does not make our health infrastructure strong and is way below the standard in a country like India.

Medical emergencies do not ring a bell on the door before approaching. This pandemic has given all of us a reality check as to how the medical infrastructure in the country needs a complete revamp. At App Deepo Bhav College, we aim to increase the paramedic/medic to patient ratio. Everything in our lives including food, clothes and shelter is secondary. Health is primary.

I consider myself immensely fortunate to be associated with App Deepo Bhav College. The vision of the institute is to produce adept medical personnel that could sustain themselves and serve the nation with commitment, honesty and dedication.

App Deepo Bhav College warmly welcomes you and wishes each one of you all the very best in your career.
