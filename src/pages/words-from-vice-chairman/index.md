> _“If you educate a girl, you educate a nation.” - Helene D. Gayle_

Patriarchy has been a devastating issue in our nation. Historically, we have seen the horrors and oppression done on women. Although we are living in 2022, the nation still needs to beat these challenges around gender inequality. Women empowerment is a pressing issue of the 21st century. The literacy rate of women in India is about 70% and for males, it is about 84%. That’s a stark difference. For the progress of our nation, we need transformative education in the coming years. We as a nation can’t think of development when only one section of the society gets to choose what the other section should do.

For an egalitarian society, we need to educate everyone about the issue. Being a woman myself, I have faced this in my day to day life. Therefore I would want to change that for society. At App Deepo Bhav, we are not only mindful of the problems but also take active steps to eradicate this evil from society.

Quality education is a building block for a developed nation. Education not only empowers but also emancipates. It makes us equipped to face the challenges of daily life. Community building is another trait that comes through education. Building communities that are inclusive, accepting and supportive are all necessary for us to bridge the gender inequality gap. We dream of a society that will be free from all communal shackles. Women will break the glass ceiling and soar in leadership positions. Indian society today lacks women in leadership roles. App Deepo Bhav College believes in empowering women for the development of the entire country.

With lots of best wishes to all the students working hard with some dreams and aspirations in your eyes, we welcome you to our college for a journey of growth and development.
